    "# Problem\n",
    "When doing flow-cell analysis of sequences, indices are added to identify sequences from specific samples. As multiple different samples are assessed simultaneously, indices are necessary to parse data from set to set. Unfortunatly, when flow cells are populated for analysis, occasionally \"index hopping\" occurs, when a DNA strand gets paired with an alternate index, misidentifying the strand."
